# Solution for SMAC
In this repository you can find my solution for the Seismic Monitoring and Analysis Challenge https://www.codabench.org/competitions/2222/#.

**Make sure that the data is in a folder named `data` and `private_set`**.

The repository contains two folders:
- `notebooks` contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
    - One explaining the training process and the inference step
    - One analysing the robustness of the pipeline
- `source` contains the necessary files for inference and an Python script to infer the private test set

The inference can be obtained by running `python3 inference.py` from the source folder.
