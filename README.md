# Solution for SMAC

🌍 In this repository you can find my solution for the [Seismic Monitoring and Analysis Challenge](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/2222/#).

🏆 This has been awarded with second prize 🥈. 

**Make sure that the data is in a folder named `data` and `private_set`.**

The repository contains two folders:
- `notebooks` contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
    - One explaining the training process and the inference step ❓
    - One analysing the robustness of the pipeline ✅
- `source` contains the necessary files for inference and an Python script to infer the private test set 📦

🛠️ The inference can be obtained by running `python3 inference.py` from the source folder.

📜 We provide a report detailing our choices in the file `report.pdf`.
